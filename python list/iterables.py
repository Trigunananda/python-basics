# In Python, an iterable is an object that includes zero, one, or many elements. An iterable has the ability to return its elements one at a time.

# Because of this feature, you can use a for loop to iterate over an iterable.

# In fact, the range() function is an iterable because you can iterate over its result:
for index in range(3):
    print(index)
